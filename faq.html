      <h2>1. What is neurodiversity-affirming therapy?</h2>
      <p>This approach recognizes and values neurodivergent individuals (e.g., with ADHD, autism, dyslexia). Instead of focusing on "fixing" these traits, it empowers clients by emphasizing strengths and offering personalized strategies to overcome challenges.</p>

      <h2>2. Do you work with children or adults?</h2>
      <p>I specialize in adults and teens but offer therapy for individuals of all ages, adapting my approach to your needs.</p>

      <h2>3. What's the difference between therapy, coaching, and consultation?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Therapy provides support to help individuals address emotional, psychological, or behavioral challenges, often focusing on healing and personal growth.</li>
        <li>Coaching is action-oriented and focuses on helping individuals build strategies, set goals, and create systems for moving forward in life or work, with a focus on present and future growth.</li>
        <li>Consultation helps organizations, healthcare providers, and educational settings implement inclusive practices through workshops, training, and guidance on creating inclusive spaces.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>4. Is neurodiversity-affirming therapy right for me?</h2>
    <p>If you're neurodivergent or need support for someone who is, this therapy may be a great fit. We can discuss your needs during an initial consultation.</p>

    <h2>5. Do you offer a reduced fee?</h2>
    <p>Yes, I offer a limited number of reduced-fee spots based on individual need. Please reach out to discuss options.</p>

    <h2>6. What is a Good Faith Estimate under the No Surprises Act?</h2>
    <p>If you don't have insurance or aren't using your insurance benefits, you have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) of what your services might cost. This estimate will list the expected charges for your care before you receive any services, such as procedures or support. If you're charged more than $400 above the estimate, you can dispute the bill.</p>

    <h2>7. Do you take insurance?</h2>
    <p>I am an out-of-network provider. To check your benefits, contact your insurance company and ask about reimbursement for out-of-network mental health services. I can provide a superbill for you to submit to your insurer.</p>

    <p>Here are some questions you can ask your insurance company to learn about your out-of-network benefits:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Do I have out-of-network benefits? Ask if your plan covers out-of-network providers.</li>
      <li>How much will you pay for out-of-network services? Find out what percentage of the cost they will cover.</li>
      <li>What is my out-of-network deductible? Ask how much you need to pay before insurance starts covering costs.</li>
      <li>Is there a limit to how much you will pay for out-of-network services? Inquire about any cap on reimbursement.</li>
      <li>How do I submit a claim for out-of-network services? Ask for the process to submit claims for reimbursement.</li>
      <li>Do I need pre-authorization for out-of-network services? Check if you need approval before seeing an out-of-network provider.</li>
      <li>What forms do I need to submit for reimbursement? Find out what paperwork is required for reimbursement.</li>
      <li>Are there limits on out-of-network therapy services? Ask if there are any restrictions for therapy services.</li>
      <li>How do I get reimbursed for out-of-network therapy services? Confirm if you need to pay upfront and how the reimbursement works.</li>
      <li>How can I track my claim's status? Ask how to check the progress of your claim.</li>
    </ul>


<h2>8. What should I expect in the first session?</h2>
<p>We'll discuss your goals, challenges, and how we can work together. This helps us create a plan for your therapy journey.</p>

<h2>9. Is therapy confidential?</h2>
<p>Yes, everything is confidential, with exceptions only if there's risk of harm or legal requirements.</p>

<h2>10. How often will I need sessions?</h2>
<p>Session frequency depends on your needs and goals. We'll collaborate to determine the best pace for you.</p>

<h2>11. How long are the appointments?</h2>
<p>The initial intake session is 60 minutes. Follow-up sessions are typically 45-50 minutes, but longer sessions can be arranged.</p>

<h2>12. When are you available?</h2>
<p>I offer evening sessions Monday through Wednesday, and weekends (Saturdays & Sundays). Contact me for group therapy or consultation availability.</p>

<h2>13. How can I book a session?</h2>
<p>Call me at (410) 262-7372 or fill out the <a href="contact.html">interest form</a>. We can schedule a 15-minute consultation to see if we're a good fit. After that, we can schedule an intake session.</p>
