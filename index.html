            <b>Are you feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or disconnected from yourself?</b>  Maybe it's hard to start tasks, stay organized, or keep up with everyday life. You might be feeling burned out, anxious, or exhausted. Perhaps  you're navigating the impact of living in a world that doesn't always support how your brain works.  Or you could be exploring who you are and wanting to feel more like your true self.<br /><br />
            
            Whatever you're working through, you don't have to face it alone. In therapy, we'll work together in a way that respects your unique experiences and supports your strengths. My clients often describe my style as warm, genuine, and approachable. You set the pace, and I'll help create a safe space for healing, understanding, and growth.

        <p>
          I offer virtual therapy for adults and teens across Maryland and 42 states through PSYPACT. My specialties include working with autistic and ADHD individuals, as well as those in the broader neurodivergent and LGBTQIA+ communities.
        </p>

        <p>In our work together, you'll find a supportive space where your experiences are respected, your strengths are valued, and your identity is affirmed. I take an authentic, person-centered, and strengths-based approach, meeting you where you are and supporting you in where you want to go.</p>

        <p>Whether you're navigating overwhelm, healing from past experiences, exploring your identity, or looking to grow in ways that align with your values, I'm here to walk alongside you. Together, we'll work to build a foundation of trust, understanding, and self-awareness — with room for autonomy, honesty, and real connection.</p>
