          <p>Looking for connection, support, or a space where you truly belong? Group therapy can be a powerful way to build community, gain insight, and grow alongside others with shared experiences. I offer a range of <b>virtual groups</b> designed for neurodivergent and LGBTQIA+ individuals, each created to meet specific needs in safe, affirming spaces.</p>

          <p><em>Limited number of reduced fee spots are available based on financial need. Please inquire to check current availability.</em></p>
