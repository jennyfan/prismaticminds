            <p><b>Clarity. Confidence. Forward Momentum.</b></p>
            <p>Coaching with me is a supportive space to help you move forward — whether you're feeling overwhelmed, navigating a transition, or just ready to build systems that work for your brain and your life. Together, we'll clarify what matters most to you, identify what's getting in the way, and build strategies that align with how you operate best.</p>
            
            <p><b>Coaching is NOT therapy.</b></p>
            <p>While I am a licensed psychologist, <b>coaching is a separate, non-clinical service</b> and is not provided under my clinical license. Therapy often focuses on healing and mental health treatment. Coaching, on the other hand, is action-oriented — focused on the present and future to help you reach your goals, improve your systems, and build momentum.</p>
            <p>If you're looking for a space to problem-solve and stay accountable — coaching might be exactly what you need.</p>
            
            <h3>What You Can Expect</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Clear goals and meaningful action steps</li>
              <li>Support for focus, motivation, and follow-through</li>
              <li>Tools for organization and time management</li>
              <li>A nonjudgmental space to explore values and direction</li>
              <li>Encouragement and accountability from someone who gets how different minds work</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Coaching Can Help With:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Life transitions and career pivots</li>
              <li>Executive functioning challenges or decision paralysis</li>
              <li>Creating personalized routines and systems</li>
              <li>Strengthening confidence, clarity, and direction</li>
              <li>Exploring building a life that feels more like you</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Coaching is a powerful space for personal and professional development — but it is not a substitute for therapy, mental health treatment, or crisis support.</b> If clinical care is needed in addition to coaching, I'll be happy to refer you to other trusted licensed providers.</p>
